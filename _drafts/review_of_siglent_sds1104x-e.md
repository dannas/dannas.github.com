title: Review of Siglent SDS1104X-E
---

Great scope for embedded work.

I've owned a Siglent DS1104X-E for 10 months and so far it has met most of my expectations.

I've used it for measuring ripple and noise on power supplies (bandwidth limited to 20MHz, AC-coupling); for decoding UART, I2C and CAN traffic; for monitoring glitches on analog power supply lines: for checking analog sensor inputs; for displaying PWM-width modulated signals; and for "plain" digital signals such as reset lines. It's worked great for all these use-cases. The built-in web server has allowed me to easily zoom in on details and to share my findings with my colleagues fast. Very useful in Corona-times when many of us are working from home.

There's been a few times when I've felt limited by just having four channels and wished that I had the logic analyzer dongle which is needed to make use of the MSO functionality. But so far I've been able to hook up my DSLogic logic analyzer to the trigger output. Has required some eye balling between the DSLogic GUI screen and the scope, but so far it's got the job done.

I've found the Eres acquisition mode useful when I've wanted to measure a signal with higher precision.

You can change the fixed point of the horizontal scaling transformation (which point stays the same place on the display) to either be the trigger or the center of the screen but it's buried deep inside sub menus. Likewise you can change if the center of the screen or the vertical offset reference should be the basis for the vertical scaling. But you again have to dig through the menu system.

Compared to the Rigol scope that I've used previously I find the knobs and button much more responsive and I enjoy the less cluttered menus.

Overall I'm very happy with my scope and would recommend it to others.
