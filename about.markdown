# About Me
I'm an embedded software developer in the automotive sector. In the evenings I occasionally hack on Mozilla Firefox. Here's a list of [all issues I've ever commented on](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&emailtype1=exact&emaillongdesc1=1&email1=dannas%40dannas.name&list_id=13734517).

I have a [twitter](https://twitter.com/dannas_) account which I haven't really figured out the use for. I do push code from time to time to [github](https://github.com/dannas) but it's most likely unpolished an experimental. I do have a [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/dannas) account as well, and that I really haven't figured out the use for. If you want to contact me, then please reach out to my email address, dannas [at] dannas.name.

# About this blog
I rarely write blog entries. But I have a [TIL, Today I Learned page](/TIL.html), that I try to update daily.
