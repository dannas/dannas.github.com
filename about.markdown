# About Me

I'm an embedded software developer in the automotive sector. In the evenings I
occassionally hack on Mozilla Firefox. Here's a list of 
[all issues I've ever commented on](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&emailtype1=exact&emaillongdesc1=1&email1=dannas%40dannas.name&list_id=13734517).

During my studies I held a part time employment,
working on the Apache Subversion source control system. You can checkout out my
[github](https://github.com/dannas) and [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/dannas)
and [twitter](https://twitter.com/dannas_).
