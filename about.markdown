# About Me
I'm an embedded software developer in the automotive sector. In the evenings I occasionally hack on Mozilla Firefox. Here's a list of [all issues I've ever commented on](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/buglist.cgi?query_format=advanced&emailtype1=exact&emaillongdesc1=1&email1=dannas%40dannas.name&list_id=13734517).

I have a [twitter](https://twitter.com/dannas_) account which I haven't really figured out the use for. I do push code from time to time to [github](https://github.com/dannas) but it's most likely unpolished an experimental. I do have a [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/dannas) account as well, and that I really haven't figured out the use for. If you want to contact me, then please reach out to my email address, dannas [at] dannas.name.

# About this blog
I rarely write blog entries. But I have a [TIL, Today I Learned page](/TIL.html), that I try to update daily.

# Some quotes

Here are some quotes related to writing and mathematics. I'm especially fond of the Leslie Lamport quote and I really wish that my writing could reach his level of clarity.

> Mathematics is a formal exoskeleton around one's intuition.

​        Jordan Ellenberg

> Who refuses to do arithmetic are doomed to talk nonsense

​        John Myles White

> Writing is nature's way of telling us how lousy our thinking is.

> Math is nature's way of letting you know how sloppy your writing is

​        Leslie Lamport

> Without writing, you are reduced to a finite automaton.

> With writing you have the extraordinary power of a Turing machine.

​        Manuel Blum

> Write code that is easy to delete, not easy to extend

​        https://twitter.com/BenNadel/status/831535012075937792

> What we need is notions, not notations.

​        Gauss
