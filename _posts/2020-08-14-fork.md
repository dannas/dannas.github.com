[Baumann, Andrew, et al. "A fork () in the road." *Proceedings of the Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems*. 2019](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2019/04/fork-hotos19.pdf).

This is a paper that only affects a small number of people: those doing OS research and those that directly call `fork` from their programs. Still, I find it interesting since it points to limitations in the UNIX design. When I learned to program, UNIX was seen as the gold standard. I remember reading an LKML post from Linus Torvalds where he meant that OS development was about the refinement of existing ideas, not so much about inventing new concepts.  But people still do OS research, and the paper describes how having to support `fork` can be a burden.

The main criticism in the paper is about how `fork` affects many other parts of the system. It was originally a very simple idea: copy the address space of the parent and let the child redirect file descriptors, reduce permissions or, alter the namespace of the child.  But `fork` today impacts all other operating system abstractions with which it was once orthogonal. Below are some practical examples of things mentioned in the paper.

## Buffered I/O and Fork

What do you think this program will print?

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(void) {
    printf("Hello World! ");
    pid_t pid = fork();
    return 0;
}
```

It prints the output twice, `Hello World! Hello World!`, since the stdio buffers are flushed both in the parent and in the child. So  in this case `fork` doesn't compose, since the calling code needs to explicitly flush I/O before calling `fork`.

## Threads and Fork

This program starts a thread that locks a mutex for 1ms. It then forks a child which tries to lock the same mutex. What do you think it will print and why?

```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <sys/wait.h>

static pthread_mutex_t thread_mutex = PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER;

static void* worker(void* arg) {
    pthread_detach(pthread_self());

    for (;;) {
      pthread_mutex_lock(&thread_mutex);
      usleep(1000);
      pthread_mutex_unlock(&thread_mutex);
    }
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t thread;
    pthread_create(&thread, NULL, worker, 0);

    usleep(1000);
    pid_t pid = fork();

    if (pid == 0) {
        pthread_mutex_lock(&thread_mutex);
        const char buf[] = "lock acquired\n";
        write(fileno(stderr), buf, strlen(buf));
        pthread_mutex_unlock(&thread_mutex);
        exit(0);
    }

    wait3(NULL, WNOHANG, NULL);

    return 0;
}
```

On my system, the subprocess always deadlocks before printing the `lock acquired` message. A child created by `fork` has only a single thread (a copy of the calling thread). So there's a good chance that the mutex will be in the locked state when the child starts executing. One common case where this happens is if a thread doing memory allocation and holding a heap lock, while `fork `is called.

## Large address spaces and Fork

How long do you think it takes to fork if the parent has 10K VMAs? Here's a test program from Chromes [Issue 819228: Consider using posix_spawn() on Linux](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=819228).

```
/* Allocates several memory ranges and reports how long it takes to fork().
 *
 * clang slow_fork.c -o slow_fork && ./slow_fork 100 10
 *
 * Almost no error checking anywhere.
 */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <time.h>
#include <unistd.h>

#define PAGE_SIZE 4096
#define SIZE 100 * PAGE_SIZE

void* mmap_anonymous(size_t size) {
  return mmap(NULL, size, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,
              MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_PRIVATE, -1, 0);
}

void** create_vmas(int count) {
  void** result = (void**) calloc(count, sizeof(void*));
  if (!result)
    return NULL;

  for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    result[i] = mmap_anonymous(SIZE);
    if (!result[i])
      return NULL;
  }
  return result;
}

void remove_vmas(void** arrays, int count) {
  for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    munmap(arrays[i], SIZE);
  }
  free(arrays);
}

void memset_all(void** arrays, int count) {
  for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    memset(arrays[i], 0, SIZE);
  }
}

struct timespec now() {
  struct timespec now;
  clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC, &now);
  return now;
}

long interval_ns(struct timespec tick, struct timespec tock) {
  return (tock.tv_sec - tick.tv_sec) * 1000000000L
      + (tock.tv_nsec - tick.tv_nsec);
}

int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  int vmas, iterations;
  void** areas;
  struct timespec tick, tock;

  if (argc != 3) {
    printf("Usage: %s <nb_vmas> <iterations>\n", argv[0]);
    return 1;
  }

  vmas = atoi(argv[1]);
  iterations = atoi(argv[2]);

  for (int i = 0; i < iterations; i++) {
    areas = create_vmas(vmas);
    if (!areas)
      return 1;

    memset_all(areas, vmas);

    tick = now();
    if (fork()) {
      // parent.
      tock = now();
      long ns = interval_ns(tick, tock);
      printf("%.2fus to fork().\n", (double) ns / 1e3);
    } else {
      _exit(0);
    }
    remove_vmas(areas, vmas);
  }

  return 0;
}
```

On my system, here are the run-times:

```
$ ./fork 1 1
149.65us to fork().
$ ./fork 10 
89.63us to fork().
$ ./fork 100 1
576.18us to fork().
$ ./fork 1000 1
2661.38us to fork().
$ ./fork 10000 1
35420.67us to fork().
```

So 35ms to `fork` with 10K VMAs. If I replace the `fork` call with `vfork` it takes only 115us! The speed difference is because `fork` needs to copy the page table entries to the new address space.

To get around these limitations some systems mark memory-mapped regions as not to be forked. Others like Chrome creates  a zygote process that has as little memory allocated as possible to ensure fast process creation times.

## Alternatives to Fork

You can use `vfork`  or `posix_spawn` instead. The `vfork` function creates a new process but does not copy the parent's page tables. Instead, it starts the child in the same address space as its parent and starts it  before the parent. The only thing that can be done from there is calling Ã¨xec`. The `posix_spawn` API is much more complicated than just calling ` `fork`, but as we've seen the simplicity comes with a great burden on modern systems.
